Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following tools installed.

Docker
Docker Compose
PostgreSQL

The application uses PostgreSQL as the database. Ensure you set up PostgreSQL with the following credentials:

Database Name: postgres_db
User: postgres
Password: postgres
Host: 0.0.0.0
Port: 5432

PostgreSQL Setup

You can set up the PostgreSQL database via the command line:

bash
Copy code
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE postgres_db;
CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE postgres_db TO postgres;
\q

Ensure the host is set to 0.0.0.0 to allow external connections. You can also configure this through a database management tool like DBeaver or pgAdmin.


Application Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/matibraun/6_cheaf.git
cd 6_cheaf

Build and run the application using Docker:

docker-compose up --build

The development server will be accessible at http://localhost:8000
